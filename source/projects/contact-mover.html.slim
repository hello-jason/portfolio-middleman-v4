    h2 An Itch Worth Scratching?

    p The story of Contact Mover revolves around Immense Networks, who brings value to other companies as their outsourced IT department. They identified a recurring pain point&mdash;moving new employeesâ€™ contacts from another Exchange server to their own; the steps involved were ridiculous.

    p People loved their BlackBerrys back then, iPhone was gaining traction, Windows Mobile was still acceptable, and few in the corporate world cared about Android. The problem was that Active Sync was implemented differently, so moving contacts was a nightmare.

    blockquote &ldquo;Build a tool that quickly and reliably transfers Exchange contacts&rdquo;

    p Surely, other IT firms were experiencing this problem and wasting just as much time. While future sales was a pipe dream, the initial goal became clear.

    = image_tag "projects/contact-mover/appicon-app-store.png", :alt => "Apple App Store logo"

    p We decided that iOS had the best compatibility for syncing with various Active Sync implementations (even better than Windows Mobile); bonus points for the fact that Immense could sell it to their own clients through the App Store.

    p As with any app icon, I wanted it to scream what the app did without text. I created a moving truck carrying the current iOS Contacts App icon (the silhouette is developer Andrew).

    = image_tag "projects/contact-mover/appicon-contact-mover-v1.png", :alt => "Contact Mover app v1.0 logo"

    p Most of the interface is a background image, reducing development time. Andrew positioned how many contacts were in each account (Exchange and Local), and he slapped 2 arrow buttons for the user to decide which way to move the contacts. This interface did not require any textual instructions, which was nice because that iPhone 3G screen was the size of a Tamagotchi.

    h2 Workflow in Need

    p When feedback became less about bugs and more about improving the workflow, I knew the app was going somewhere. And they were right; version 1 required users to toggle between Settings and Contact Mover a few times.

    p The workflow went like this:

    ol.big-list
      li <span class="number">1</span> <span class="text">Ensure <em>only</em> the old Exchange account is enabled</span>
      li <span class="number">2</span> <span class="text">Open Contact Mover and transfer contacts upwards into local Contacts</span>
      li <span class="number">3</span> <span class="text">Disable the old Exchange account and enable the new one</span>
      li <span class="number">4</span> <span class="text">Back in Contact Mover, transfer contacts downwards into the new Exchange account</span>

    p Contact Mover had been available for 2 years at this point, so we decided to expand who it could benefit. This would require a simplistic interface and support more account types (Gmail, Hotmail, iCloud, and so forth).

    p Forget Active Sync support&mdash;it should allow the average user to move contacts between nearly any 2 accounts.

    p I believe my original icon concept was successful, and that legacy should simply be updated for version 2. The new icon would be inspired by iOS 7 and reference the updated Contacts app. And Iâ€™d finally give Contact Mover an identity, complete with a sexy purple color scheme.

    = image_tag "projects/contact-mover/appicon-contact-mover-v2.png", :alt => "Contact Mover app v2.0 logo"

    p Version 2 requires the user to choose source and destination address books. Instructions are large and concise, select fields are practically big enough to hit with elbows, and clicking the Next button is the obvious goal on the page.
